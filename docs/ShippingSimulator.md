# Shipping Simulator

The Econverse Components' shipping simulator features six components and a context provider to give flexibility for any layout you want. Before we begin, here are all the components we are going to use:

- ShippingSimulatorProvider
- ShippingSimulatorForm
- ShippingSimulatorInput
- ShippingSimulatorSubmit
- ShippingSimulatorErrorMessage
- TranslatedEstimate

## Configuration

1. Import the `econverse.components` app to your theme's peer dependencies in the `manifest.json`.
```diff
"peerDependencies": {
+ "econverse.components": "2.x"
}
```
2. Add the `e-shipping-simulator-provider` to any template of your choice.
3. Then, declare the `e-shipping-simulator-provider` block using the `e-shipping-simulator-form` as child. For example:
```jsonc
"e-shipping-simulator-provider": {
  "children": ["e-shipping-simulator-form"]
}
```
4. Now, declare the `e-shipping-simulator-form` block and feel free to fill it the way you want, using the previously listed components. For the following example, we will be featuring a simple rich text as label, a "Don't know my postal code" link and put the form elements (input and submit) next to each other using `flex-layout`:
```jsonc
"e-shipping-simulator-provider": {
  "children": ["e-shipping-simulator-form"]
},
"e-shipping-simulator-form": {
  "children": [
    "rich-text#shipping-simulator-label",
    "flex-layout.row#shipping-simulator-fields",
    "e-shipping-simulator-error-message",
    "link#dont-know-my-cep",
    "e-shipping-simulator-results"
  ]
},

"rich-text#shipping-simulator-label": {
  "props": {
    "blockClass": "shipping-simulator-label",
    "text": "Calcular frete"
  }
},

"flex-layout.row#shipping-simulator-fields": {
  "children": ["e-shipping-simulator-input", "e-shipping-simulator-submit"],
  "props": {
    "blockClass": "shipping-simulator-container"
  }
},
"e-shipping-simulator-submit": {
  "props": {
    "message": "calcular",
    "disableWhileInvalid": true
  }
},

"link#dont-know-my-cep": {
  "props": {
    "label": "NÃ£o sei meu CEP",
    "href": "https://buscacepinter.correios.com.br/app/endereco/index.php?t",
    "target": "_blank",
    "blockClass": "dont-know-my-cep"
  }
},

"e-shipping-simulator-results": {
  "props": {
    "readOnly": true
  }
}
```
